# Postfix Calculator

This was done as a course project for data structures and algorithms course.
Hello dear teacher, please don't be too harsh :( 

A postfix calculator is a simple arithmetic calculator that uses postfix notation, to perform mathematical operations. The calculator uses postfix notation, which is a way of writing math problems where the operator (e.g. +, -, *, /) comes after the numbers being operated on (e.g. 2 2 + instead of 2 + 2).
