# Postfix Calculator

This was done as a course project for data structures and algorithms course. Hello dear teacher, please don't be too harsh :( 

A postfix calculator is a simple arithmetic calculator that uses postfix notation, to perform mathematical operations. The calculator uses postfix notation, which is a way of writing math problems where the operator (e.g. +, -, *, /) comes after the numbers being operated on (e.g. 2 2 + instead of 2 + 2).


## Creator

Karam Chafqane


## Langueage

**C++/C**


## Features

You can find the following features from my implementation:

* Addition (+)
* Subtraction (-)
* Multiplication (*)
* Division (/)
* Sum of elements
* Average of elements


## Implementation

The PostFix Calculator is built with an array that mimics a stack behaviour. The calculator uses postfix notation, which is a way of writing math problems where the operator (e.g. +, -, *, /) comes after the numbers being operated on (e.g. 2 2 + instead of 2 + 2). 


## Compilint the program

To compile the program with GNu g++ compiler, run the following command in your terminal:

```
g++ ./cppFiles/main.cpp ./cppFiles/stack.cpp ./cppFiles/functions.cpp -o run
```


## Running the program

To run the program after compiling, use the following command in your terminal:

```
./run
```
